*getFromDatabaseById:*

Takes the model name argument and a second string argument representing the unique ID of the element. Returns the instance with valid inputs and null with an invalid id.

addToDatabase:

Takes the model name argument and a second argument which is an object with the key-value pairs of the new instance. addToDatabase handles assigning .id properties to the instances. It does not check to make sure that valid inputs are supplied, so you will have to add those checks to your routes if necessary. addToDatabase will return the newly-created instance from the database. This function will validate the schema of the instance to create and throw an error if it is invalid.

updateInstanceInDatabase:

Takes the model name argument and a second argument which is an object representing an updated instance. The instance provided must have a valid .id property which will be used to match. updateInstanceInDatabase will return the updated instance in the database or null with invalid inputs. This function will validate the schema of the updated instance and throw an error if it is invalid.

deleteFromDatabasebyId:

Takes the model name argument and a second string argument representing the unique ID of the element to delete. Returns true if the delete occurs properly and false if the element is not found.

deleteAllFromDatabase:

Takes only the single argument for model name. Deletes all elements from the proper model and returns a new, empty array. You will only need to use this function for a /api/meetings route.
